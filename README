GhostForm
=========

A simple plugin to give you a ghosted form using jQuery for the javascript. 

TODO
=======
Lots of cleaning up, at the moment it's kinda hacked together to get this job out the door. I'll be back don't worry.


Example
=======

-ghosted_form_for resource_name, :url => session_path(resource_name), :html => {:id => "login_form"} do |f|
  %p.email
    =f.text_field :email, :ghost => "Email"
  %p.password
    =f.password_field :password, :ghost => "Password"
    
Will produce a form with ghosted email and password fields.
